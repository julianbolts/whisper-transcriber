Don't forget to enable the venv with (because the vscode extension forgot this time):

`source  ./.venv/bin/activate`

then 

`pip install openai-whisper`

before running the script, example:

`python transcribe.py input/GMT20250715-162056_Recording.m4a output/csa-onboarding-shadowing.transcript.txt`
